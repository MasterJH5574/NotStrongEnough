        Let $T$ be a minimum spanning tree of $G$, and let $c\in \mathbb{R}$.
        Show that $T_c$ and $G_c$ have exactly the same connected components. (That is, two vertices $u,v\in V$ are connected in $T_c$ if and only if they are connected in $G_c$).
        You are encouraged to draw pictures to illustrate your proof.

    \begin{proof}[Solution]
        Since $T_c$ is a subgraph of $G_c$, if $u,v\in V$ are connected in $T_c$, then $u,v$ are connected in $G_c$.
        
        Now let's assume $u,v\in V$ are not connected in $T_c$, but are connected in $G_c$.
        Then, the path in $T$ from $u$ to $v$ contains an edge $y$ whose weight is greater than c.
        Also, there exists a path $P$ in $G$ from u to v such that $\forall e\in P, w(e)\leq c$.
        If we remove $y$ from $T$, $T$ will be split into 2 connected components where u belongs to one and v belongs to another.
        So there must be an edge $x\in P$ whose endpoints belongs to different connected components.
        Adding $x$ into $T$ then will make the 2 components connected again.
        Let $T'=T+x-y$.
        Now $T'$ becomes a tree, because it has $|V|-1$ edges and it's connected.
        The total weight of  $T'$ is $w(T)+w(x)-w(y)<w(T)$, which violates that $T$ is an MST\@.
        So $u,v$ are not connected in $G_c$ if they are not connected in $T_c$.

        In conclusion, two vertices $u,v\in V$ are connected in $T_c$ if and only if they are connected in $G_c$.
    \end{proof}
