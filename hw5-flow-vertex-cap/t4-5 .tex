    In the two exercises below, let $\Gamma(X)$ be the neighbors of $X$. 
    \begin{thm}{}{}
        Consider the induced bipartite subgraph $H_n[L_i\cup L_{i+1}]$, show that for $i<n/2$ the graph has a matching of size $|L_i|=\binom{n}{i}$
    \end{thm}
    \begin{proof}
        Use Hall's Theorem, the size of maximum matching equals $\min_{X\subseteq L_i}|L_i|-|X|+|\Gamma(X)|$. 

        Since in $H_n[L_i\cup L_{i+1}]$ the degree of each vertex in $L_i$ is $n-i$, 
        and that of each vertex in $L_{i+1}$ is $i+1$, there is $|X|(n-i)\leq|\Gamma(X)|(i+1)$. 
        As $i<n/2$, $|X|\leq|\Gamma(x)|\frac{i+1}{n-i}\leq|\Gamma(X)|$, and only if $|X|=0$ can the equality be achieved. 

        So there is $\min_{X\subseteq L_i}(|L_i|-|X|+|\Gamma(X)|)=|L_i|=\binom{n}{i}$. 
    \end{proof} 

    \begin{thm}{}{}
        Show that there are $\binom{n}{i}$ paths in $H_n$ starting at $L_i$ ending in $L_{n-i}$ and are disjoint. 
    \end{thm}
    \begin{proof}
        We first set a new point $s$ connected to all vertices in $L_i$ and a new point $t$ connected to all vertices in $L_{n-i}$. 
        
        Set the capacity of edges starting from $s$ or ending to $t$ be $1$, and the capacity of the rest be $\infty$. 
        Then there is a flow that, for edges whose capacity is $1$ the flow takes $1$; for the rest edges, 
        each in form of $(u,v), u\in L_k,v\in L_{k+1}$, the flow takes $\frac{\binom{n}{i}}{\binom{n}{k}(n-k)}$. 

        It is obvious that the flow is well-defined, that for each vertex (except for $s,t$) the flow in equals the flow out. 
        And the total flow is $\binom{n}{i}$. Besides, it is the maxflow since the flow out of $s$ is no more than $\binom{n}{i}$. 

        So there exists a min-cut of the graph that the size of the cut is $\binom{n}{i}$ as well. 
        The collection of the end point of each edge in the cut is a vertex cut, 
        so the size of the minimum vertex cut is $\binom{n}{i}$. 
        By Menger's Theorem, there are $\binom{n}{i}$ disjoint paths from $s$ to $t$, 
        by removing $s$ and $t$ of these paths, we get $\binom{n}{i}$ disjoint paths from $L_i$ to $L_{n-i}$ 
        
    \end{proof}
