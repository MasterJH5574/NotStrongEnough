    \begin{thm}{}{}
        Let $G = (V, c)$ be a flow network. Prove that flow is ``transitive'' in the following sense: if $r, s, t$ are vertices, and there is an $r$-$s$-flow of value $k$ and an $s$-$t$-flow of value $k$, then there is an $r$-$t$-flow of value $k$.
    \end{thm}

    \begin{proof}
        Note that there is an $r$-$s$-flow of value $k$ means that the value of the maximum $r$-$s$-flow is at least $k$, which also means that the value of the minimum $r$-$s$-cut is at least $k$. Similarly, the value of the minimum $s$-$t$-cut is also at least $k$.
        
        Now consider an $r$-$t$-cut. It is either an $r$-$s$-cut (if $s$ is not in the cut) or an $s$-$t$-cut (if $s$ is in the cut). So the capacity of the minimum $r$-$t$-cut is at least $k$. It follows that the value of the maximum $r$-$t$-flow is at least $k$, and thus there is an $r$-$t$-flow of value $k$.
    \end{proof}
