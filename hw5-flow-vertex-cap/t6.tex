        Let $\nu(G)$ denote the size of a maximum matching of $G=(V,E)$.
        Show that a bipartite graph $G$ has at most $2^{\nu(G)}$ mimimum vertex covers.
    \end{thm}
    \begin{proof}
        From the K\"{o}nig's Theorem, we know that the size of mimimum vertex cover is $\nu(G)$ if $G$ is a bipartite graph.
        Let $C$ be a minimum vertex cover.
        Then we can construct new minimum vertex covers by choosing vertices from $C$ and $V\setminus C$.
        In other words, all minimum vertex covers can be represented by $X\cup Y$, where $X\subseteq C, Y \subseteq V\setminus C$.
        Denote $N(A)=\{b \mid \exists a\in A, \text{ there is an edge between } a \text{ and } b \}$.
        For all $X\subseteq C$, to construct a vertex cover, $Y$ must touch all edges touched by $C\setminus X$ but not by $X$.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If $N(C\setminus X)\cap (C\setminus X)\ne \emptyset$, there does not exist such a $Y$.
            \item  If $N(C\setminus X)\cap (C\setminus X)= \emptyset$, then $Y$ must be at least $N(C\setminus X) \cap (V\setminus C)$ to be a vertex cover.
            To make $X\cap Y$ a minimum vertex cover, $Y$ has to be $N(C\setminus X) \cap (V\setminus C)$.
        \end{itemize}

        Since $X$ has $2^{\nu(G)}$ choices, $G$ has at most $2^{\nu(G)}$ mimimum vertex covers.
    \end{proof}
